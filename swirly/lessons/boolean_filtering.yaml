  Learn how to filter rows of a DataFrame using boolean conditions and logical combinations.

steps:
  - prompt: "A DataFrame 'df' was created. Filter its rows where column 'a' is greater than 1."
    answer: "df[df['a'] > 1]"

  - prompt: "Filter rows where column 'b' equals 4."
    answer: "df[df['b'] == 4]"

  - prompt: "Filter rows where column 'a' > 1 and column 'b' < -1."
    answer: "df[(df['a'] > 1) & (df['b'] < -1)]"

  - prompt: "Filter rows where column 'a' > 1 or column 'b' > 3."
    answer: "df[(df['a'] > 1) | (df['b'] > 3)]"

  - prompt: "Reset the index of the filtered DataFrame."
    answer: "df[df['a'] > 1].reset_index(drop=True)"
